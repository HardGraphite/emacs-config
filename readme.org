* Emacs configuration

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 100px
[[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/images/emacs.png]]

This is my configuration directory (=~/.config/emacs/=)
for the GNU Emacs editor.

** Dependencies

- =GNU Emacs= 29
- =GNU Make=
- various fonts, see =userconf.el.0=

The followings are optional:

- =ripgrep=: text search tool, used by package =xref=
- =clangd=: language server for C/C++, used by package =eglot=
- =cmake-language-server=: language server for CMake, used by package =eglot=
- =pyright=: language server for Python, used by package =eglot=
- =texlab=: language server for LaTeX, used by package =eglot=
- =pandoc=: markup language converter, used by package =markdown-mode=
- =verilator=: Verilog HDL/SystemVerilog simulator, used by package =verilog-mode=

** How to setup

Run "=make setup=" to setup.

Or,

1. Run "=make autoloads=" to generate autoloads file for "=./lisp=".
2. Run "=make packages=" to install packages.
3. Run "=make bytecode=" to byte-compile ELisp files in this directory.

Notes:

- Do step 2 after introducing new packages.
- Do steps 1 and 3 after modifying "=lisp/*.el=" files.
- Step 3 is optional.

On some special platforms like Android,
Emacs cannot be called from the command line, let alone doing setup using =make=.
The script =misc/init-setup.el= can be used as an alternative solution.
Read the commentary part of that file for usage.

  "=userconf.el=" is loaded by "=config.el=", before other configuration entries.
- Private data shall be put into "=userconf.el=" or "=custom.el=",
  which are excluded from the version control system.
