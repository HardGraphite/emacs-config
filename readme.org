** Conventions

In =init-*.el= files, there are conventions:

- Use file variables: =-*- lexical-binding: t; no-byte-compile: t; -*-=.
- Configurations are separated by heading title lines,
   whose format is like: "=;;;;; {HEADING} ;;;;= ..."
- When using an external package, its name, function and repo/doc URL
  shall be recorded in comments starting with "=;;;="
- Self-defined variables and functions for external packages
  shall have names starting with "=+="

** Tools

A few tools are available in the Makefile.
Use command "=make help=" to list it usage.
